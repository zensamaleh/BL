# Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the changes made to the BL Management application:

## 1. Fixed API Error Handling

### Frontend Changes (src/backend/api.ts)
- Improved error handling in the `request` method to properly display error messages instead of "[object Object]"
- Added proper error type checking to handle different error formats
- Enhanced error logging with descriptive messages

### Backend Changes (backend/src/middleware/auth.ts)
- Improved error responses in the authentication middleware
- Added more descriptive error messages in development mode while keeping generic messages in production
- Enhanced error logging with better context

### Backend Changes (backend/src/controllers/authController.ts)
- Improved error handling in the login method with more descriptive error messages
- Enhanced error handling in the verifyToken method with better error reporting
- Added conditional error messages based on environment (development vs production)

## 2. Deployment Guide

### New File (DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
- Created a comprehensive step-by-step deployment guide for deploying the application on a VPS without Nginx
- The guide covers server preparation, application deployment, firewall configuration, and more
- Includes instructions for both frontend and backend deployment using PM2 for process management

## 3. Bug Fixes

### Frontend Changes (src/backend/api.ts)
- Fixed a typo in the `validerSaisie` method: `newtoISOString()` was corrected to `new Date().toISOString()`

These changes improve the application's error handling, making it easier to diagnose issues, and provide a clear path for deployment on a VPS without requiring Nginx.
